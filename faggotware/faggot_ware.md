## Dynamic Analysis

- The malware makes the syscall `sys_rt_sigprocmask` that modifies the signal masking of the system so that it does not give any  interrupt when it detects the malware.

- The malware changes its directory to `/` by the `sys_chdir()` syscall to hide itself from the user.

- The malware makes a socket having (IPv4 connection along with a SOCK_DGRAM protocol).

- It calls the function `sys_socket` and `sys_getsockname` with the argument `0x35002` as the `struct sockaddr`. This represents the whole struct made for the socket to connect to the IP address mentioned.

- It sets the `sys_listen()` function with second argument  = 1 setting the max limit of the connections made to the malware from the users only 1.

- It calls the function ``
